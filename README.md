# live-gnome-wallpapers

## what is it?
A simple set of XML wallpapers that use the images from OSX Mojave and others to create a nice dynamic wallpaper over the course of the day.
The images that aren't from MacOS are property of 24hourwallpaper.com and you should go check them out as they have a bunch of cool stuff.


## prerequisites
- GNOME3+ (may work with older versions idk)
- gnome-tweak-tool

## installation
- Download or clone repository & unpack to **"/home/ACCOUNT/Pictures/wallpapers"** (eg. "home/kevin/Pictures/wallpapers/*")
- Open the .XML file in each of the folders that you want to use and perform the next step
- Replace the account name "lloyd" with your own (**this is important as it won't work without doing this**)
- Open gnome-tweak-tools and go to Desktop, select the XML file in your desired wallpaper folder

## roadmap
- will add install script that places the files in the right location and modifies the account name to your current account
- make more I guess
